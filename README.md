# Product Scraper

A Python script to scrape product details (names, prices, and ratings) from an e-commerce website and save the data in a structured CSV format.

## Features
- **Scrapes Product Information**:
  - Product Name
  - Price
  - Rating (if available)
- **CSV Export**:
  - Saves the scraped data into a `products.csv` file for easy access and analysis.
- **Dynamic URL Input**:
  - Allows the user to specify the URL of the e-commerce webpage.

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your system:
1. **Python 3.6 or later**
2. Required Python libraries:
   - `requests`
   - `beautifulsoup4`
   - `csv` (built-in)

### Install the Required Libraries

Run the following command to install the necessary libraries:
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Download the Script**:
   Save the Python script to your local system (e.g., as `scraper.py`).

2. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script in your terminal or IDE:
   ```bash
   python scraper.py
   ```

3. **Input the Webpage URL**:
   - When prompted, enter the URL of the e-commerce webpage you want to scrape.

4. **View the Output**:
   - The script will save the scraped data into a CSV file named `products.csv` in the same directory as the script.

## CSV Output Example

The resulting CSV file (`products.csv`) will look like this:

| Product Name               | Price    | Rating  |
|----------------------------|----------|---------|
| Apple iPhone 14 Pro        | $999.00  | 4.8     |
| Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra   | $1,199.00| 4.7     |
| Sony Noise-Canceling Headphones | $299.99 | 4.5     |

## Customization

The script uses placeholder CSS selectors like `.product-class`, `.product-name-class`, `.product-price-class`, and `.product-rating-class`. 

To make the script work for your target website:
1. **Inspect the Webpage**:
   - Right-click on the page in your browser and select **Inspect**.
   - Locate the classes or tags for product containers, names, prices, and ratings.
   
2. **Update the Selectors**:
   - Replace the placeholder selectors in the script with the actual class names or tags from the website.

Example:
```python
for product in soup.select('.actual-product-container-class'):
    name = product.select_one('.actual-product-name-class').text.strip()
    price = product.select_one('.actual-product-price-class').text.strip()
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Dynamic Websites**:
   - If the webpage content is generated dynamically via JavaScript, the script might not work. Use Selenium for such cases.

2. **Anti-Bot Measures**:
   - Some websites may block scraping attempts. To avoid this:
     - Use headers with a realistic User-Agent string.
     - Add delays between requests to prevent detection.

3. **Legal Restrictions**:
   - Check the target website's terms of service before scraping to ensure compliance.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for JavaScript-rendered pages using Selenium.
- Implement proxy rotation to avoid IP bans.
- Extend functionality to scrape additional product details (e.g., descriptions, images).
